Compatible Hardware
The library uses the Arduino Ethernet Client api for interacting with the underlying network hardware. This means it Just Works with a growing number of boards and shields, including:

Arduino Ethernet
Arduino Ethernet Shield
Arduino YUN – use the included YunClient in place of EthernetClient, and be sure to do a Bridge.begin() first
Arduino WiFi Shield - if you want to send packets > 90 bytes with this shield, enable the MQTT_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE define in PubSubClient.h.
Sparkfun WiFly Shield – library
TI CC3000 WiFi - library
Intel Galileo/Edison
ESP8266(NodeMCU)
